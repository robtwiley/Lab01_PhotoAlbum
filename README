== Rails II, Lab #1, Photo Album 
== Rails II, Lab #2, Extends Photo Album with User Authorization and Authentication

== Robert Wiley, 09/26/2010

== Site uses these gems/libraries:
	authlogic for User authentication (logging in)
	declarative_authorization for User authorization (rights to site functionality)

== Test users:

		Username		Password	 Role
		========		========	 ====
		admin			test		 Administrator
		mod				test		 Moderator
		user			test		 User

== Yet to do:
	Unit testing for user, role
	Functional testing for user, role, authorization and authentication
	   user/mod/admin can logout, etc.

== Questions:
    1) Need to see how to test user_sessions
